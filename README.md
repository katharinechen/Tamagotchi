#Tamagotchi

##About 
This project was completed by Katharine Chen and Austin Steward for [Epicodus Code School(Week#2)](http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/tamagotchi).

##Description 
Tamagotchi were popular when I was young. They were a type of electronic pets that you would carray around with you and pressed buttons to feed it, play with it, and put it to sleep. If you forgot to give it enough food or attention, it would die. We made a web version of this popular game. Click buttons to keep the Tamagotchi pet alive - OR ELSE!

For fun, type in "Hammer" as the name of your Tamagotchi.
